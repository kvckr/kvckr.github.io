# SOLID

|Initial|Stands for|
|-|-|
|S|Single responsibility principle|
|O|Open/closed principle|
|L|Liskov substitution principle|
|I|Interface segregation principle|
|D|Dependency inversion principle|

**S.** Class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality. A class should have only one reason to change.

**O.** A class should be closed for changes and opened for extensions.

**L.**  If we replace base class with derived class, behavior should not change.

**I.** Don’t use fat interface. A class should not be forced to depend on methods that it does not use.

**D.** High-level modules shouldn’t depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
