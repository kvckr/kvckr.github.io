# OOP

## Base terms

**OOP** is a programming paradigm based on **the concept of “objects”**, which may **contain data (fields) and behavior (methods)**.

**Class** is a **template for creating objects**. A class **describes all the attributes** of objects and **the methods that implement the behavior** of member objects.

**Object** is an **instance of class**. **Attributes and behavior** of an object are **defined by the class definition**.

## Main principles

**Abstraction** is a process of **exposing only the relevant and essential data** to users without showing unnecessary information.

**Polymorphism** is the ability to present the **same interface for different data types**. There are **static** (as method and operator overloading) and **dynamic** (as virtual method overriding) polymorphism. **Static** is a **compile-time** polymorphism and **dynamic** is a **run-time** polymorphism.

**Encapsulation** is the **packing of data and functions into one component**. It prevents the data from unwanted access 

**Inheritance** is the mechanism by which an object **acquires the some or all properties** of another object. This provides an opportunity to reuse the code functionality and reduces code repetition.
